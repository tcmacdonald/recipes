ingredients:
  - 2 green apples (any crisp variety)
  - 1/4 white onion, thinly sliced
  - 1" piece of fresh ginger, grated
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1 – 2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean chili powder)
  - 1 tablespoon rice vinegar

* Cut the apples into 1/8″ thick slices, avoiding the core. You can leave the skin on. Cut the slices into 1/2″ wide strips. The easiest way to do this is on a mandoline – you can do the whole thing in one move with the wide julienne cutter.
* Put all ingredients in a bowl and use your hands to toss it thoroughly, working the gochugaru into the apple. Taste and adjust seasoning to your preference.
* Reserve in refrigerator until ready to use. Use within a couple of hours or it can become too soggy.
