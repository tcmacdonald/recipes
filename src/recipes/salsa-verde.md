ingredients:
  - 1 pound tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed
  - 1 garlic clove
  - 2 jalapeño or serrano chiles, or to taste

* Place the tomatillos, garlic, and chiles in a medium saucepan and cover with water.
* Bring to a simmer and cook until the tomatillos change from bright green to pale green and are soft but not falling apart, about 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatillos, garlic, and one of the chiles to a blender or food processor. Add the onion, cilantro, and salt and purée until smooth.
* Taste for heat, and add more chile if necessary until you have the desired amount of heat. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until hot but not smoking.
* Pour the salsa into the saucepan and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
