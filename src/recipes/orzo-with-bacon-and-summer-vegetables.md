* Render the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, until crispy. Remove bacon pieces with a slotted spoon and place on some paper towels to drain.
* Drain all but 2 Tbs. bacon fat. Add the onions to the pan and sauté until they start to soften, 4 minutes. Add the garlic, scallions, lemon zest, thyme and sage to the skillet. Season with the crushed pepper and a little salt. Sauté another minute, or until that mix is pretty fragrant.
* Add the tomatoes, broccoli and peas to the pan. The juice from the tomatoes will create a very light sauce, so you’ll simmer the mix until the veggies soften, 5 minutes. You may add a little water to help it along if you want!
* In the meantime, boil the orzo until al dente, just a few minutes. Reserve a few Tbs. of the pasta water and drain the rest.
* Add the bacon back to the pan. Add the cooked orzo to the pan and give everything a good toss. If you need to add a little pasta water for a little more “sauce,” go right ahead. Taste it. What do you think? Little more salt? What about some lemon juice? oooOOOooo.
* Garnish with fresh basil and parmesan cheeeeese, if ya want. Dive on in.
