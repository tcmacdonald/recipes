ingredients:
  - 1 1/4 pounds white boiling potatoes (about
  - 4 large), peeled and sliced
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
  - 1/2 cup buttermilk
  - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
  - 2 teaspoons unsalted butter Freshly ground pepper to taste

* Place the potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain, reserving a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid.
* Place the potatoes in a large bowl and mash partly. Cook the buttermilk in a saucepan over low heat to warm it; do not let the buttermilk get too hot or it will separate. Add it and the baking soda to the potatoes and mash completely.
* Stir in the butter and additional salt and pepper to taste. If you like very creamy mashed potatoes, add the reserved cooking liquid. Serve immediately.
