ingredients:
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1 tbsp. baking powder
  - 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
  - 1 tsp. fine-grain sea salt (table salt works, too!)
  - 1 1/2 stick (6 ounces) unsalted butter, cold
  - 1/2 cup buttermilk, cold and shaken
  - 1 large egg, cold
  - 5 tbsp. chives, minced
  - 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar
  - 1 large egg
  - 1 tbsp. buttermilk

* Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
* In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients: all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using a box grater, grate the cold butter into the flour mixture. Transfer the bowl to the freezer while you gather the wet ingredients, about 5-7 minutes.
* Measure out the buttermilk and add the egg; whisk until combined. In a small bowl, make the egg wash; whisk together the egg and buttermilk together. Transfer both to the refrigerator.
* Grab the bowl out of the freezer, using your hands and working quickly, gently break up the butter and combine with the flour until it resembles small peas. Add the chives and cheddar, and mix until both are thoroughly combined. All at once, add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and mix until combined. Lightly knead the dough in the bowl until it forms one solid mass.
* Liberally dust your kitchen counter with flour and dump the dough onto it. Press the dough into a 3/4-inch thickness. Cut out the biscuits using a 2-inch biscuit cutter. You'll end up with about 6 biscuits. Recombine the scraps to get 2 more biscuits. Transfer the biscuits to a lined baking sheet.
* If you think you've been moving slowly (i.e., answer the phone, Instagramming, etc.), stick the baking sheet in the freezer for 5 minutes; this will get the bits of butter cold again. After the biscuits are cold, brush the tops with the egg wash and bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes, until tall and golden brown. Serve warm with honey, jam or butter.
