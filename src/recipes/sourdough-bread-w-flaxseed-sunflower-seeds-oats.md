* Feed your starter.
* Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make a "bowl" in the center of the mixture and add the wet ingredients. Stir until well-blended. Cover and let stand in a warm spot.
* Remove dough from bowl (if it rose alot, you can knead it a few times). Divide into three pieces and put into greased loaf pans (I like glass pans). Cover and let stand overnight.
* Dough should have risen to look like a loaf of bread. If it rose too high above the sides of pan, gently tuck edges under. If not risen enough, you can put it in a warmer spot or in the oven with the light on for awhile.
* Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes.
* Allow to cool about an hour before removing the pan. Stores well in plastic bags at room temperature. Also freezes well in plastic bags. Wait until 100% cooled before putting into bags.
