* In a small bowl, combine chicken, 1 cup cheese, green chiles, salt and pepper.
* In a small skillet, bring enchilada sauce to boil. Remove from heat.
* Dip each tortilla into heated sauce for a few seconds to soften.
* Spoon â…“ cup of chicken mixture and 2 tablespoons sour cream down center for each tortilla. I usually put the sour cream in a sandwich bag and cut the bottom tip which makes it easier to squirt right down the center.
* Roll the tortilla and place seam-side down in 8x8 (or 9x9) inch baking dish.
* Pour remaining heated enchilada sauce over top. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese.
* Bake 20 minutes at 350. Makes 4 servings.
