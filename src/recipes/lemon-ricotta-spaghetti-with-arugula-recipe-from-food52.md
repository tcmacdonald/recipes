ingredients:
  - 1/2 pound spaghetti [I use whole wheat but use whatever you prefer]
  - 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
  - 2 cloves garlic, sliced lengthwise as thinly as possible
  - 2 tablespoons lemon zest, from
  - 1-2 lemons juice from 1 lemon
  - 1 pinch red pepper flakes
  - 1 cup fresh ricotta, homemade or best quality
  - 4 to 6 tablespoons leftover ricotta whey or leftover pasta boiling water
  - 4 cups lightly packed arugua salt

* Bring a pot of well salted water to boil
* While the water is coming to a boil, slice the garlic and put a small saute over low heat. Add the olive oil, the garlic, and a nice pinch of salt. Let the oil and garlic slowly heat up. You don't want the garlic to brown. You are just warming the oil and letting garlic infuse it.
* While the oil and garlic are doing their thing, zest the lemon and wash and dry the arugula.
* Once the water comes to a boil, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain and reserve some pasta water if you don't have any ricotta whey.
* Once the pasta is boiling, turn the heat under the saute pan to as low as it goes and add the ricotta, lemon zest, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. You just want it all to warm it up while the pasta is cooking.
* Once you drain the pasta, add it to the saute pan and toss well. Add 1/4 cup of whey or cooking water and the arugula and toss again to coat and wilt the arugula. If you feel it is too dry, add up to 2 more TB of whey or cooking water. Taste for salt and add the juice from 1/2 a lemon and toss once more.
* Serve, topping each bowl with a few sprinkles of coarse salt or fleur de sel and a few drops of lemon juice.
