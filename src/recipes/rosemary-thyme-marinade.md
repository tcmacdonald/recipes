* Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl or resealable bag.
* The orginal recipe did not include marinating times but I would suggest at least 2 hours for chicken, preferably overnight. Since fish tends to cook in marinades, 30 minutes should do. For vegetables, firmer vegetables can go longer but something like zucchini or yellow squash might be ready in 20-30 minutes.
