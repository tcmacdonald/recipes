* Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
* Line a 9-inch square baking sheet with foil, allowing the foil to extend over the sides. Spray with nonstick cooking spray.
* Mix the oats, cranberries, almonds, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl.
* Combine the butter, sugar and honey in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the butter melts and the mixture begins to boil. Add the vanilla and stir. Remove from the heat.
* Pour the butter over the oats, mixing until well coated. Transfer to the prepared pan and, using a spatula, press the oats evenly into the pan.
* Bake until the top is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool. Using the foil as aid, lift out of the pan and place on a work surface. Crumble into pieces. Serve with berries, plain yogurt and drizzle with additional honey.
