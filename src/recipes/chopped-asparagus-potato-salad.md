ingredients:
  - 2 pounds of rose potatoes (or any small sized waxy potato), cut into fourths or eighths with the skin on
  - 3 large eggs
  - 1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cups asparagus, chopped into
  - 1/2 inch pieces
  - 1/2 cup tarragon and cilantro salsa verde
  - 1/4 cup mayo salt and pepper
  - 4 fresh tomatillos
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves plucked
  - 2 tablespoon tarragon, roughly chopped
  - 1 poblano pepper (hint: it’s the large dark green one)

* First make the salsa verde: Heat oven to 450 F. Peel the papery shell off the tomatillos with your hands, then rinse them tomatillos. (Note: they’re surprisingly sticky-this is normal). Arrange on a baking sheet.
* Place the garlic in aluminum foil, drizzle with olive oil, and close up the foil. Place foil sachet on the baking sheet with the tomatillos.
* Roast for 10 minutes, then remove the garlic and crank the oven up to broil. Broil the tomatillos for 5-7 more minutes, or until browned and oozing.
* Using a pair of tongs, char the poblano pepper over an open flame until the skin is black all over (you can also broil it if an open flame isn’t available). Once it has cooled, scrape off the blackened skin, slice off the top and remove the seeds.
* Put the tomatillos, cilantro, garlic, and poblano in a food processor. Blend together until a TK consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste, then set aside.
* Now, for the potato salad: In a pot of room temperature water, add the cut up potatoes and a tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until tender (but not mushy).
* Drain the potatoes and toss with half of the salsa verde while still warm.
* While the potatoes cool, boil the asparagus in salted water for 1 minute, until bright green and tender. (Note: 30 seconds will do it for thin asparagus, and you may need up to 2 minutes for thick asparagus.) Then dunk in ice water.
* Meanwhile, add the eggs to a pot of room temperature water, bring to boil, and turn off the heat. LEAVE ON THE BURNER OR TAKE OFF THE BURNER? Let the eggs sit for 8-10 minutes in the hot water, then drain and pop in an ice bath until you’re ready to use. (This method makes sure you don’t get any of those gray rings around your yolks.)
* Peel the eggs and chop each into 8 wedges.
* Add the eggs, asparagus, onion, and mayo to the potatoes, then mix everything together and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle remaining salsa over the finished dish.
