* Heat a stockpot or other tall wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom. When the oil is hot, add the onions, garlic, fermented black beans, chilies and scallion whites. Saut√© until lightly caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tamari sauce and deglaze the pot. Add the edamame, the white and black beans, tomatoes with their juice, and stock and bring to a simmer. Add the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until the mixture has reduced by one-quarter, 45 to 60 minutes.
* Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the yogurt, scallion greens and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. Serve from the pot or transfer the chili to four individual serving bowls. Serve with yogurt on the side.
