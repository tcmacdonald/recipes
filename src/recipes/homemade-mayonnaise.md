ingredients:
  - 1 large egg yolk
  - 1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
  - 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
  - 1/2 - 2 tablespoons chopped pimientos
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 3/4 cup olive oil

* Grab your egg yolk. Toss it in a large bowl. Add the salt, powdered mustard, and lemon juice. Whisk that up until it’s uniform.
* Slowly (and I mean slowly), drizzle a little oil into the egg yolk mixture, whisking as you go. Whisk until the oil is completely incorporated and the mixture is uniform. It will start to fluff up. That’s a good thing.
* When you’ve completely incorporated that first bit of oil, drizzle in a little more. Whisk until completely incorporated. Keep repeating (drizzle/whisk) until you’ve incorporated all the oil. You get the idea.
