* Heat the oven to 375Â°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Coat a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with butter and set aside.
* Place the cornbread in a large bowl; set aside.
* Melt the measured butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the apples, celery, onion, salt, sage, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the wine, stir to combine, and cook until the wine is almost all evaporated, about 2 minutes.
* Pour the apple mixture over the cornbread, add the broth and eggs, and stir until combined and thoroughly moistened.
* Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and spread it into an even layer. Bake uncovered until the top is golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and let cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.
