* Beat egg, add remaining ingredients in order listed and beat with rotary beater until smooth.
* Grease heated griddle if necessary. To test griddle, sprinkle a few drops of water. If bubbles skitter around, heat is just right.
* Pour batter from tip of large spoon or from pitcher onto hot griddle. Turn pancakes as soon as they are puffed and full of bubbles but before bubbles break. Bake other side until golden brown.
