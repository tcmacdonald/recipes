ingredients:
  - 4 Chicken breasts halves, with skin and bone
  - 2 medium brown onions, sliced thin
  - 2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 T Olive oil
  - 1 generous pinch Saffron Juice from one lemon salt and pepper, to taste

* Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. A well-seasoned cast iron skillet is my preferred pan, but a casserole works as well. Put 1 T. oil in the bottom of pan, and then layer in the onions.
* Lay the chicken on top of the onions. Salt and pepper. Sprinkle the garlic over the chicken, and then the Saffron. Drizzle with remaining olive oil.
* Bake until brown, and chicken is cooked through. In a convection oven with cast iron, about 30 min. With a glass dish, about 45.
* Squeeze the lemon over the skillet. Let rest for 5 min. before serving.
