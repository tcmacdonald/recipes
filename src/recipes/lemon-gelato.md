* In a nonaluminum saucepan, combine the half-and-half and cream. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest of 1 lemon in long strips. Add to the cream mixture. Place over medium heat and bring just to a simmer.
* Meanwhile, grate the zest from the remaining 2 lemons. In a food processor, combine the sugar and grated lemon zest and process until well mixed. In a bowl, combine the egg yolks and lemon sugar. Whisk until pale and smooth. Slowly whisk in the hot cream, then return the mixture to the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture visibly thickens and coats the spoon, about 4 minutes. Do not allow it to boil or it will curdle.
* Remove from the heat and stir for 1 minute. Let cool for 15 minutes, then whisk in the crème fraîche. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 8 hours.
* Strain the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.To serve, scoop the gelato into serving dishes.
