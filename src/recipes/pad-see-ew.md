ingredients:
  - 1 lb Chinese broccoli
  - 1 tablespoon Dark Soy Sauce
  - 1 egg
  - 1 lb Fresh Flat Rice Noodles
  - 2 cloves chopped garlic
  - 2 tablespoons Light Soy Sauce
  - 1/2 cup thinly sliced pork
  - 1 tablespoon sugar

* If your fresh flat rice noodles are not pre-cut, cut them into strips of 3/4 inch wide. If your fresh noodles came out from the refrigerator, heat them up in the microwave first.
* Cut Chinese broccoli into 2 inch long pieces. Halve the stems lengthwise because thick stems take longer to cook. You are going to want to cook them at the same time.
* Heat a wok to high heat and then add 2 tablespoons of oil. Drop in the chopped garlic and stir. Add the sliced pork. Stir to cook the pork. When the pork is somewhat cooked or turned from pink to light brown, add rice noodles. Stir to break up the noodles. Add light and dark soy sauce and sugar.
* Stir to mix the seasonings into the noodles and pork. Open a spot in the middle of the pan, and drop the egg in. Scramble the egg until it is almost all cooked (not watery any more). Fold in the noodles and mix them all.
* Add the Chinese broccoli, stems first. I usually add half of the Chinese broccoli and stir until it wilts and then add the rest. But if you have room in your wok, you can cook all the Chinese broccoli at once. As soon as the Chinese broccoli is cooked, turn off the heat.
* Put on a serving plate and sprinkle white pepper on top. Serve with the usual noodles condiments; sugar, fish sauce, vinegar and dried ground chili pepper. I usually like mine with ground chili peppers and vinegar.
* Pad see ew that you find in Thailand is little sweeter than mine because many street vendors add more sugar than I
