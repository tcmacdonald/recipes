ingredients:

* Wash and pick over cranberries for foreign pieces. Combine in heavy saucepan with sugar, water and orange juice. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and cook at a gentle boil until most cranberries have popped. (Don't wait until all of them pop; otherwise, the cranberries will become too soft.) Remove from heat.
* Stir in Grand Marnier, and chill.
* A couple of hours before serving, stir in the pecans.
