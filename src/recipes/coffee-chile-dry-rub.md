  - 1/4 cup finely ground dark-roast coffee

  - 1 tablespoon ground cumin

* In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients thoroughly, massaging the mixture with your fingers to break down the dark brown sugar into fine crystals.
* Liberally sprinkle a thin layer of the rub onto the steak, then pat it in with your fingers so it adheres.
