* Prepare rice according to package directions, but add bay leaf with water for flavor (if desired). Generally, the rice will cook in 1/2 hour.
* Combine black-eyed peas, garlic, salt and pepper in a saucepan over medium-low heat until warm, about 20 minutes.
* Combine all the sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan, cover and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, uncovered, until tomatoes break down and the sauce is thickened to your taste, 20 to 45 minutes.
* To assemble: On each plate, layer rice, then black-eyed peas, then sauce. Top with cheese, peppers and onions.
