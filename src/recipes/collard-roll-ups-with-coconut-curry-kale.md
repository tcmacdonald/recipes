* To blanch collard leaves: In a large sauté pan add water to coat bottom of pan, about 1 inch. Bring to a boil. Place a collard leaf in pan and blanch leaf until it turns bright green in color, about 10 to 15 seconds on each side. Repeat with remaining leaves. Let cool, then cut out the thick part of the spine leaving at least 8 inches to fill and roll. Set aside.
* In a large sauté pan over medium heat, add coconut oil. Once melted, add garlic, orange juice, orange zest, maple syrup, curry powder, and sea salt. Mix well and sauté until mixture begins to bubble, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Add kale and toss to coat. Cook until the kale becomes tender and wilted, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
* Place a collard leaf top side down on a cutting board. Layer 1/4 of the sautéd kale and spread it in the center of the leaf horizontally. Then add a quarter of your avocado slices and a 1/4 of your carrot ribbons. Roll collard from the bottom around ingredients like a sushi roll. Cut any excess from the leaf at the end. Slice with a sharp knife into 1 1/2 inch sections. Sprinkle with freshly grated horseradish and enjoy! Yum!
