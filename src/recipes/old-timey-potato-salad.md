* If you peel potatoes while they are still warm, they'll absorb flavors better. Cut them into 1-inch dice into a large bowl. Gently fold in the onion, vinegar, mustard, sugar, celery seed, and salt and pepper to taste. Let stand 30 minutes to an hour at room temperature.
* Then fold in the celery, egg, and mayonnaise.  At this point, it's best to let the salad rest a minimum of 1 hour or so in the refrigerator so flavors can meld. It can even be refrigerated up to 3 days. But because potatoes absorb and mute seasonings, taste it before serving and adjust vinegar and seasonings if needed.
