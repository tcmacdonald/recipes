ingredients:
  - 1 small to medium head Napa cabbage, discolored or loose outer leaves discarded
  - 2 tablespoons kosher or coarse sea salt
  - 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 20 garlic cloves minced
  - 20 pieces of peeled, fresh ginger, minced
  - 1/2 cup kochukaru (Korean chili powder)
  - 1/4 cup fish sauce
  - 1/4 cup usukuchi (light soy sauce)
  - 2 teaspoons jarred salted shrimp
  - 1/2 cup 1-inch pieces scallions (greens and whites)
  - 1/2 cup julienned carrots

* Cut cabbage lengthwise in half, then cut the halves crosswise into 1-inch wide pieces. Toss the cabbage with the salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar in a bowl. Let sit overnight in the refrigerator.
* Combine the garlic, ginger, kochukaru, fish sauce, soy sauce, shrimp and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl. If it's very thick, add water 1/3 cup at a time until the brine is just thicker than a creamy salad dressing but no longer a sludge. Stir in the scallions and carrots.
* Drain the cabbage and add it to the brine. Cover and refrigerate. Though the kimchi will be tasty after 24 hours, it will be better in a week and at its prime in 2 weeks. It will still be good for another couple weeks after that, though it will grow incrementally stronger and funkier.
