* Pour boiling water over 1/2 tsp saffron (about 20 threads). Let the saffron infuse in the hot water for 10 minutes. Remove the threads and add the water to sour cream.
* Stir the saffron water and sour cream together until thoroughly incorporated. Cover, and return to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, so that the mixture can thicken. Add salt and cilantro and set aside.
* Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
* Mix spices together in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spice mixture on both sides of each chicken breast. Place the chicken breasts on a cookie sheet and bake for 25 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Slice up the chicken into pieces.
* While the chicken is cooking, you can prepare the tomato-onion salsa. Place onion in a small bowl and pour 1 cup of hot tap water over the onion. Let the onion sit in the hot water for 2-3 minutes. Drain. Add the tomato and kosher salt.
* To prepare your wraps, spread a layer of the Saffron-Cilantro Sour Cream onto the bottom of your favorite pita or tortilla. Add one chicken breast, and top with the tomato-onion salsa. Sprinkle with a bit of fresh lime juice and some chopped cilantro.
