* Add the butter and the pancetta to a pan over medium heat. Render the pancetta until it just starts to get crispy while being careful not to burn the butter. You may need to reduce the heat to do this but be patient.
* Add the onions, season them with salt and pepper. Now continue cooking the onions, stirring occasionally, till they are soft.
* Add the broth and farro. Turn the heat up if you need to and bring the pot to a boil. Add the peas, taste the broth and season it as necessary.
* Add the parsley and cook the soup until the peas are just tender. Be careful not to overcook the peas.
* Serve immediately garnishing the soup with more fresh ground black pepper.
