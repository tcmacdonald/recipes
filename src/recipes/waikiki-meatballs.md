* Mix thoroughly beef, crumbs, onion, egg, salt, ginger, and milk.
* Shape mixture by rounded tbsp into balls.
* Melt shortening in large skillet; brown and cook meatballs. I put on medium and watch closely and turn as needed.
* Remove meatballs and keep warm or I just set aside for the moment as I am usually making the sauce while meatballs are cooking but do not forget to be cooking the 5 minute rice before starting the meatballs.
* Pour or wipe fat from skillet.
* Mix cornstarch and sugar. Stir in reserved pineapple juice, vinegar, and soy sauce until smooth.
* Pour into skillet; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils or I bring it to a boil in the saucepan. Boil and stir for about 1 minute.
* Add meatballs, pineapple tidbits, and green pepper; heat through. I usually add the green pepper last after mixture is heated through to keep the peppers fresh.
