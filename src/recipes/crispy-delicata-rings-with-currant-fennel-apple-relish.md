ingredients:
  - 2 Delicata squash salt olive oil
  - 1 lime
  - 1/2 cup dried currants
  - 1/2 crisp apple, peeled, seeded, very small dice (I used Pink Lady)
  - 1 fennel bulb, outer layer removed, very small dice
  - 1 cup apple cider
  - 1 tablespoon Calvados

* Slice the ends off of the squash. Slice into 1/2" rings and remove the seeds with a spoon. Reserve the seeds for another use or roast them with some cayenne pepper, salt, and cumin and sprinkle over the finished dish.
* Lightly salt the squash and let sit for 30 minutes. Completely dry off with paper towels, removing the salt. Heat enough oil to coat a saute pan over medium high heat. Lightly salt the squash rings with fresh salt and add them to the pan. They should sizzle the moment they hit the pan. Don't crowd them or they'll steam more than they'll brown. Saute until lightly browned (about 2 minutes per side).
* Remove to a plate and grate lime peel over them and squeeze lime juice on them. I used the juice and zest from 1/2 lime for each Delicata.
* Top with the Currant, Fennel and Apple Relish and serve warm. Optional: top with spiced roasted squash seeds.
* Combine all ingredients in a small pot and simmer over medium low heat until the cider is reduced by half. Strain and sprinkle over the Crispy Delicata Rings.
