* Heat outside grill to preheat, closing the lid and allowing the grill to become as hot as possible.
* In a small bowl, stir all spices together. Place chicken in a shallow baking dish, and pour melted butter over the chicken, rubbing to coat well. Sprinkle spice mixtures generously over chicken, ensuring all sides are well coated.
* Place chicken on hot grill, then turn the heat immediately down to the lowest setting possible. Allow to cook for 5-6 minutes.
* Flip chicken, allowing it to grill on the other side until cooked through.
