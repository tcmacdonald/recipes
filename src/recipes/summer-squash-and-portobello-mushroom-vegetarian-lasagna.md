ingredients:

  - 6 large portobello mushroom caps, sliced
  - 1/8" thick on a bias extra virgin olive oil for sauteeing
  - 1 lb. ricotta
  - 2 eggs
  - 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
  - 1 onion, diced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 large (28 oz.) cans plain tomato sauce zest from

* In a large skillet over high, fry the squash and portobello mushrooms in olive oil. Fry each in a single layer, using as many batches as needed. Flip and cook both sides until well browned. Remove to paper towels and season with salt.
* Season the ricotta along with nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, then beat in the eggs.
* Saute the onion & garlic in a good amount of olive oil, add the tomato sauce and lemon zest, simmer 5 minutes. Add salt to taste.
* Oil an 11" x 13" pan (at least 2" deep). Build up layers of noodles, sauce, squash and mushrooms, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella. Be sure to get the noodles quite wet if they are the no-boil type and need plenty of moisture. You'll have about 4 layers total. I do sauce on every layer, but ricotta on some and mozzarella on others. Do what you feel.
* Finish with a heavy layer of mozzarella and the parm, mixed together.
* Bake at 375 F., covering with tin foil part of the time if needed to avoid overbrowning. It is done when internal temp is say 170 F. (check a few spots) or when you can easily pierce the noodles with a fork, and the sauce is bubbling around the sides. Don't overcook and let the noodles get soggy.
* If the cheese isn't crispy and brown enough, finish judiciously with the broiler.
* Allow to rest at least 15 minutes before serving so it has time to set up a bit.
