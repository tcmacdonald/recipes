* Slice the onion
* Bring the vinegar, sugar, spices, and salt to a boil. Once boiling, dump in the red onion, stir for a few seconds until the rings begin to break up, and turn off the heat.
* Remove from the heat and let sit until at room temperature.
* Once the mixture is at room temperature, press the onions into the container you're using and pour over the vinegar. Cover it and put it in the fridge!
