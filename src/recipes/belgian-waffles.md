* In large bowl, sift flour, cornstarch, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt to blend thoroughly; set aside.
* In stand mixer, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add sugar; continue beating just until stiff peaks form; set aside.
* Whisk together egg yolks, milk and vanilla. Using a rubber spatula, stir milk mixture into flour mixture, blending just until dry ingredients are moistened. Do not over mix- there should still be small lumps.
* Stir in melted butter. Fold in beaten egg whites until combined.
