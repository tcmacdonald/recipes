* To make the glaze, combine the orange juice, yuzu juice and honey in a small bowl. Season with salt & pepper. Remove 1/4 cup of the mixture to a second small bowl and set both bowls aside.
* Fill a large bowl with water and add ice. Cook the beans in abundant boiling water until tender crisp, 2 to 3 minutes for the haricots verts,4 to 5 minted for regular beans. Using a large strainer, transfer the beans to the ice water. When cold, drain the beans. If using regular beans, cut them into 1-inch lengths. Set beans aside.
* Preheat the oven to 375F. Season the chicken well with salt & pepper.
* Heat a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and brown, turning once, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter and pour out all but 1 tablespoon of the fat. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions. Season with salt and pepper and saut√©, stirring until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
* Return the chicken to the pan and brush with the glaze. Transfer to the oven, bake for 10 minutes, and brush again with the glaze. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the chicken is done, 20 to 25 minutes in all. Transfer the onions to a large bowl.
* Meanwhile, in a small bowl, blend the orange zest, mustard, the reserved 1/4 cup of brushing syrup and the yogurt.
* Add the rice and beans to the bowl with the onions. Add all but 2 tablespoons of the mustard-yogurt mixture and toss lightly. Season with salt & pepper.
* Carve the chicken or keep in halves. Transfer rice and beans mixture to a plate and top with the chicken. Drizzle with the remaining mustard-yogurt mixture and serve.
