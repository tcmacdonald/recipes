* In a small bowl, add the water, sugar and yeast.  Let sit for 5-6 minutes until frothy.
* While the yeast is working, mix the canola oil, yogurt and egg in a large bowl. Add the yeast mix and stir. Add the salt and one cup of flour, and mix. Continue adding more flour until the dough comes together.  Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead, adding more flour if needed. You should need the 3 cups of flour.
* Place the dough into an oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Set in a warm place for 1 hour, until doubled in size.
* Once the dough has risen, cut into 8 equal pieces. Roll out to about half an inch thick, using more flour if needed. Once all the dough has been rolled out, heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add about a tbsp of oil to the hot pan and then add the first dough round. Cook for 3-4 minutes until browned and bubbly, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
* Repeat with the remaining dough rounds. You will need to add more oil to the pan each time. Serve hot and with your favorite Indian dish.
