title: Special Spaghetti Cake
ingredients:
  - 600 ml double cream
  - 4 large free-range eggs sea salt freshly ground black pepper
  - 60 g mature Cheddar cheese, grated
  - 60 g mixed smelly cheese (such as Brie, Stilton and goat's cheese), cubed
  - 2 large handfuls baby spinach, washed, spun dry and roughly chopped

* Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. In a large bowl beat the double cream and eggs with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Add the grated Cheddar, most of the smelly cheese, the spinach, chilli, sun-dried tomatoes and the cooked spaghetti. Gently stir to mix well.
* Melt the butter in an ovenproof frying pan, around 11inches in diameter, and swirl it around so the base of the pan is nicely coated. Slowly pour in the spaghetti mixture and shake the pan to even the mixture out. Bake in the hot oven for 30 minutes until it starts to crisp on top. At this point, take it out of the oven and use the back of a spoon to make small indents into the top of the bake. Toss the sage leaves in a little olive oil then press one into each dip with a small cube of the remaining cheese on top.
* Return to the oven and cook for 10 more minutes until crisp. Remove and leave to rest for a few minutes. Serve in lovely wedges with a fresh green salad on the side.
