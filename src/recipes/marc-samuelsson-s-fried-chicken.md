ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons kosher salt
  - 2 cups water
  - 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
  - 16 fresh sage leaves, torn
  - 2 cups buttermilk
  - 2 dashes Tabasco sauce
  - 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/2 teaspoon chile powder
  - 1 teaspoon celery salt
  - 1 cup all-purpose flour
  - 1/2 cup semolina flour
  - 2 tablespoons cornstarch Peanut oil, for frying
  - 1 garlic bulb Lemon wedges, for garnish

* Dissolve the salt in the water in a large bowl. Add the chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 11/2 hours.
* Remove the chicken from the brine, carefully separate the skin from the flesh, and place the torn sage leaves underneath the skin. Pat the skin back down.
* Discard the brine and, in the same bowl, combine the buttermilk, Tabasco, black pepper, chile powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of the celery salt. Add the chicken, making sure it’s covered with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, or as long as overnight.
* Take the chicken out of the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you’re ready to fry. In a shallow bowl, whisk the flours, cornstarch, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon celery salt.
* Fill an 8-quart pot half full with peanut oil and heat it to 340°F. Slice off and discard the top quarter of the garlic bulb; put the large piece in the hot oil. When the garlic is a rich golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, remove it and drain it on a rack.
* Wipe the excess marinade off the chicken and roll in the flour mixture; shake off the excess. Fry the chicken for 10 minutes, turning occasionally. Transfer to a rack set over a baking sheet and let it rest for 15 minutes.
* Heat the oil to 360°F and fry the chicken again, until the crust is a deep golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
* Serve the chicken with lemon wedges and rainbow slaw and the garlic.
