* Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 4 qts. cold water in large bowl. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well.
* Heat bacon in large Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and almost fully rendered, 5-8 minutes. Add onion, green pepper, and celery; cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 6-7 minutes. Stir in garlic, thyme, paprika, bay leaves, cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp black pepper; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in beans, broth, and water; bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat and vigorously simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are just soft and liquid begins to thicken, 45-60 minutes.
* Stir in sausage and 1 teaspoons red wine vinegar and cook until liquid is thick and beans are fully tender and creamy, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, additional red wine vinegar. Serve over rice, sprinkling with scallions, white cheddar and passing hot sauce separately, if desired.
