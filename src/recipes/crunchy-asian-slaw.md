* Prepare dressing by combining all of the listed ingredients (except olive oil and salt/pepper) in a medium-sized bowl. While whisking everything together, slowly stream in oil as you continue whisking. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed. Set aside.
* In a large bowl combine cabbages, carrot, red pepper and 3 of the chopped green onions. Set aside.
* Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Crunch up the ramen noodles and add them into the melted butter. Add sesame seeds and slivered almonds as well and brown everything, stirring often. Once itâ€™s nicely browned, remove the skillet from the heat.
* Add the noodle mixture to the cabbage mixture along with dressing. Toss to combine. Juice the lime over the top of the salad. Add remaining 2 green onions and more sesame seeds, if desired. Toss to combine, then serve.
