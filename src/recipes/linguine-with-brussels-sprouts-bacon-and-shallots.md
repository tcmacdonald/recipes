* Wash the Brussels sprouts Cut each Brussels sprouts into quarters, cutting from the top of the sprout to the bottom (not horizontally). Set aside.
* Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 7-10 minutes. When done, discard about 1/4 of the rendered fat. Keep the remaining in the skillet along with the bacon. Stir in the shallots and saute over medium heat until tender and caramelized, 3-5 minutes.
* Add the sprouts and 1/4 cup of water to the pan. Season with salt and pepper, turn the heat to medium, and cook covered and undisturbed for about 3-5 minutes. Sprouts should be nearly tender.
* When the sprouts are ready, uncover and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook until excess water has evaporated and sprouts have reached desired tenderness â€“ but do not overcook. Remove from heat. Stir in the pasta, balsamic vinegar, thyme, and additional salt (if desired).
* Serve immediately and top with freshly grated Parmesan.
