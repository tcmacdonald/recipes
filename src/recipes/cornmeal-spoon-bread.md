ingredients:
  - 2 cups milk
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 3/4 cup cornmeal
  - 4 tablespoons butter
  - 4 eggs, separated

* Bring the milk and salt to a boil and reduce the heat to simmer. Stir in the cornmeal and continue to stir until it thickens. Add the butter. Remove from the heat and beat in the egg yolks, slightly beaten. Cool slightly and fold in the whites, stiffly beaten. Bake in a buttered 1 1/2 quart casserole or souffl√© mold at 375 degrees about 40 minutes.
* Note: Instead of separating the eggs, you may beat them whole and add to the mush mixture. Place in a buttered baking dish about 9X9X3 inches and bake at 375 degrees 1 hour.
