* To mix dough in a bread machine:
* Put all ingredients except for the buttermilk in the pan of your bread machine. Program bread machine for the dough cycle and hit start.
* To mix dough in a stand mixer:
* Put all ingredients except the buttermilk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 10 minutes, or until a smooth, elastic dough is formed. Remove the bowl from the mixer, cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1-2 hours.
* To mix dough by hand:
* Add all ingredients except for the buttermilk to a large mixing bowl. Use a sturdy wooden spoon or your hand to stir until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 15 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1-2 hours.
* To form rolls:
* 1. Lightly grease an 11-inch by 13-inch baking sheet or line the pan with a silpat or parchment paper. Set aside. 2. Divide dough into 3 equally sized pieces and form into logs. 3. Divide each log into 5 equal pieces for standard sized rolls or 4 equal pieces for larger Italian sausage or hoagie rolls. 4. Working with one piece at a time, pat each piece out into an oval. 5. Press an indentation down the length of the center of the oval with the side of your hand. 6. Roll the dough up around the indentation. 7. Pinch the seam together lightly. 8. Roll the pieces gently seam side down until about 6-inches in length. 9. Transfer the pieces of dough to the lined baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between the pieces, and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until puffy, about 30 minutes. 10. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. 11. Brush the puffy dough generously with buttermilk. 12. Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until deep golden brown. 13. Cool the rolls on a rack for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
* To serve as a hot dog or sausage roll:
* Make a slice down the center of the top of the roll nearly through to the bottom. Gently pry open with your fingers to hold the hot dog or sausage.
* To serve as a hoagie or sandwich roll:
* Lay the roll on its side and slice it in half about midway up the roll.
* To store leftovers:
* Wrap tightly and store at room temperature for up to two days. They can be wrapped tightly and frozen for storage up to a month.
