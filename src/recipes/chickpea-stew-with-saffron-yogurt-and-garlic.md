ingredients:

  - 3 cups cooked chickpeas or 1 1/2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained
  - 4 cups vegetable broth

* In a medium-large pot over medium-high heat, combine the olive oil, onion, and a couple of big pinches of salt. Cook until the onions soften up a bit, a few minutes.
* Stir in the chickpeas, and then add the vegetable broth and garlic. Bring to a simmer and remove from heat.
* In a medium bowl, whisk the saffron and egg yolks, then whisk in the yogurt. Slowly add a big ladleful, at least 1 cup, of the hot broth to the yogurt mixture, stirring constantly. Very slowly whisk this mixture back into the pot of soup.
* Return the pot to medium heat and cook, stirring continuously for another 5 minutes or so, until the broth thickens to the consistency of heavy cream, never quite allowing broth to simmer.
* Ladle into individual bowls and serve sprinkled with a touch of paprika and plenty of chopped cilantro.
