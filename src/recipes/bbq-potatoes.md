* Get your BGE (or oven) going and keep it steady at 350Fº (175Cº).
* Use an ovenproof dish. Place the peeled and washed (even-sized) potatoes in there and make sure they fit snuggly together.
* Add the grated garlic or powder to the broth and heat it for a minute to get the flavors going. Pour hot broth in there until there’s about 1 inch of broth in the dish and sprinkle a little salt and pepper on top of the potatoes.
* Place a tiny slice of butter on top of each potato. As the potatoes start to cook the butter will melt all over, it’s delicious. Not diet-friendly, but very tasty.
* Maybe I should have called them BBQ Butter Potatoes? Oh well.
* Place the dish in your BBQ or oven and give them 35 to 40 minutes. Check them for readiness.
* I gave mine almost 10 minutes extra. Mainly because I really like a crunchy brown bottom-layer.
* Sprinkle the potatoes with finely minced parsley and if you really want to up the flavors: squeeze some lime or lemon juice on top. It’s crazy good.
* Note: a BBQ gives far more direct heat than an oven does, so when using your oven you will have to dice the potatoes or adjust the cooking time.
