ingredients:
  - 8 ripe Roma tomatoes (about
  - 2 pounds), rinsed
  - 2 to 3 tomatillos (about 1/4 pound), husks removed, rinsed
  - 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 1 cup chopped white onion
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
  - 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
  - 1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
  - 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
  - 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher or coarse sea salt, more or less to taste
  - 2 tablespoons sauce from chipotle chiles in adobo
  - 1 whole chipotle chile in adobo, chopped (optional)
  - 5 cups cooked shredded chicken, or shredded rotisserie chicken
  - 1 1/2 cup chicken broth

* Place the tomatoes and tomatillos in a medium 3-quart saucepan and cover with water. Set the saucepan over medium-high heat, bring to a simmer, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes and tomatillos are thoroughly cooked and mushy, but not coming apart. Their color will change from bright to dull. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a blender or food processor. Cool slightly and then process until smooth.
* Heat the oil in a large 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and cook until soft and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until it becomes fragrant and begins to lightly brown, less than a minute.
* Carefully pour the pureed tomato-tomatillo sauce into the skillet. It will steam and bubble; that’s ok! Stir in the oregano, marjoram, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Add the adobo sauce and the chipotle chile if using (you can add more sauce and chiles near the end if you decide you want more heat). Continue to simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until it deepens in color, becoming a darker and earthier red, and is no longer soupy, 10 to 12 minutes. You may want to partially cover the skillet with a lid as it cooks, as the sauce will spatter.
* Add the chicken and the chicken broth to the sauce and toss over the heat until it’s well mixed. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken has absorbed almost all of the sauce and is moist but not runny, 6 to 8 minutes more. Serve hot.
