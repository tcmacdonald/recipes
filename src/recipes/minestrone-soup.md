* Soup is a great way to make the most of seasonal produce – vary your choices throughout the year and stock up on what’s in season.
* Make up a big batch of soup, even if you’re only cooking for yourself – you can keep the rest in the fridge for light suppers, packed lunches, and even freeze portions in sandwich bags to eat another day.
* Save the rinds from your Parmesan cheese and pop into your soup for some extra flavor, just remember to remove before serving – those little piece of rind that you’d normally throw away are super tasty and not to be wasted.
* This soup is great for using up any odds and ends of pasta – bash up any big pieces up so they cook a bit quicker.
* Heat a large pot over a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil. Throw in the bacon and fry it gently until it starts to turn brown and smell fantastic. Add the garlic, onion, carrots, celery, zucchini, leek, oregano and bay leaf and cook slowly for about 15 minutes, stirring now and then, until the vegetables have softened.
* Add the tomatoes, potato, chick peas and vegetable broth, then cover with a lid and bring everything slowly to the boil. Simmer for about 30 minutes, then check (with the tip of a paring knife) that the potato is soft and cooked through.
* After that, add the kale and pasta, and cook for 10 more minutes, until the pasta is cooked. If the soup is too thick for you after cooking the pasta, thin it with a little more broth or water.
* The basil is optional but I think it is a nice little addition. If you decide to use it, stir some chopped leaves into the soup. Finish by seasoning with a little salt and black pepper and pass the Parmesan around the table for people to sprinkle on their soup.
