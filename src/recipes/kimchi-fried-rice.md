ingredients:
  - 4 cups old cooked rice (cold)
  - 8 slices of bacon, sliced into 1 cm pieces
  - 3 eggs lightly beaten
  - 2 cups frozen peas, defrosted
  - 3/4 cup kimchi, roughly chopped
  - 2 tablespoons kimchi liquid from your jar of kimchi
  - 1/2 onion, diced oil

* Heat some oil in a wok over high heat. When the oil is shimmery, add the diced onions, stirring until cooked, but not brown. Remove the onions from the wok and put in a bowl on the side.
* There should still be ample oil in the wok, if not, add a tiny bit more and scramble your lightly beaten eggs until mostly set, but not over cooked. The eggs will cook a bit more when you fry all the ingredients together. Remove the eggs from the wok and add them to the bowl with the onions.
* Cook the bacon until crisp. Remove and put in the bowl with the onions and eggs.
* If youâ€™re concerned about how much fat you consume, remove the bacon fat from the wok, otherwise, add the rice and fry it, stirring occasionally until all the clumps are broken down and the rice is heated, about five minutes.
* Add the onions, eggs, bacon, and peas and fry until all ingredients are mixed throughout the rice.
* Add the chopped kimchi and kimchi liquid, mixing thoroughly. Serve immediately.
