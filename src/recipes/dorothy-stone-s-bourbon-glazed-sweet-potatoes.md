ingredients:
  - 3 pounds medium-large sweet potatoes, of uniform size
  - 4 tablespoons melted butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
  - 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup bourbon

* Scrub the sweet potatoes, place in a pot, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and cook until barely tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
* When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them, and slice in rounds 1/4 inch thick.
* Use 1 tablespoon of the butter to grease a shallow baking dish about 10 inches by 14 inches.
* Arrange the potato slices, slightly overlapping them, in the dish, and drizzle with the remaining butter. Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle evenly with the sugar. If desired, the dish can be prepared in advance up to this point and set aside, covered, for 3 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.
* Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bake the potatoes for 20 minutes, then lower oven temperature to 350 degrees, and bake 20 minutes longer, until the potatoes are nicely glazed.
* Just before serving, warm the bourbon in a small saucepan. Wear oven mitts, and stand back from the pan. Ignite the bourbon, and pour it, still flaming, even over the potatoes. Serve at once.
