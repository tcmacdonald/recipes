ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons minced shallot
  - 2 tablespoons chopped basil
  - 2 tablespoons chopped chives
  - 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
  - 1 small clove garlic, minced
  - 2 teaspoons teaspoons lemon juice or white wine vinegar
  - 1/2 cup mayonnaise
  - 2 tablespoons yogurt or sour cream
  - 1 cup well-shaken buttermilk Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika, optional Honey, as needed

* In a jar with a tight fitting lid, combine the shallot, herbs, garlic, vinegar or lemon juice, mayonnaise, and yogurt or sour cream. Screw on the the lid and shake the jar to combine. Stir in most of the buttermilk. Check for consistency, and add more if needed. Taste, then season with salt, pepper and paprika. If the dressing is too sharp, drizzle in some honey to mellow the acidity. Taste again, and adjust if needed.
* Cover and refrigerate for an hour before using, to allow the flavours to blend and develop.
