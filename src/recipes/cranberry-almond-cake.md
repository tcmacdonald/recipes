* Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease a 10 inch round spring form pan.
* Combine topping ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
* Whisk together flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.
* Put eggs and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl and use an electric mixer) and beat on medium-high speed for 5 minutes, until the mixture is light and increased in volume. Then decrease speed to low and drizzle in the melted butter in a slow stream. Increase the speed to medium and beat for an additional 2 minutes. Stir in almond extract.
* Gently but thoroughly fold in the flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time. Fold in the cranberries. Scrape batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top with a spatula. Sprinkle the almond topping evenly over the top of the cake.
* Bake until golden brown and a toothpick in the center comes out clean, about 40-55 minutes.
