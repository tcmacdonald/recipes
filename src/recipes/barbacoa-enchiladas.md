* Place the beef roast, taco seasoning, chiles and about a cup of water in a large pot. Cook on medium-low for about 3 hours. Keep turning the meat every 30 minutes or so and checking to see if it needs more liquid. Add more if needed.
* Remove the beef from the pot and shred with two forks. Place back into the pot and keep on low until you're ready to assemble the enchiladas.
* Preheat oven to 350 F.
* Pour about 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Move the dish around to coat the bottom.
* Evenly divide the beef among the 8 tortillas. Sprinkle with the diced bell pepper. Roll each enchilada up and place in the dish, seam-side down. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the enchiladas.
* Sprinkle with cheese. Slide into the oven for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is browned and bubbly. If you need to broil it at the last minute, that's fine.
* Serve enchiladas garnished with chopped tomatoes and cilantro sprigs.
