* Preheat a medium cast iron skillet over high heat. Add the oil and garlic. A few seconds later, add the rice and break up large clumps. Allow to cook, stirring only occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until there are some nice browned bits. Add the kale, salt, and soy sauce and cook for about another 5 minutes until the kale is completely tender.
* Transfer the rice to a bowl and turn off the heat. Put the egg in the skillet and use the residual heat to cook it. Slide on top of the rice, garnish with the green onion, season with salt and pepper, and enjoy.
