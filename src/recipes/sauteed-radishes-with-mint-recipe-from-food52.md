* Heat oil and butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Let butter melt and then cook a bit longer, until itâ€™s a deep golden and beginning to take on a nutty smell, about 2 minutes total.
* Add radishes to pan and toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook for 8-10 minutes, tossing frequently, until radishes are tender and tinged with caramelization in places. Let cool slightly and sprinkle with mint and additional salt to taste.
