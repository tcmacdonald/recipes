ingredients:

  - 2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 3 tbsp sugar
  - 2 tsp baking powder

* Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.
* Cut up the strawberries into small pieces and add 1 tbsp of the sugar to them.
* In a large bowl, add the flour, salt, baking powder and remaining sugar. Add the butter and using 2 knives or a pastry blender start cutting into the butter. Use your hands if necessary but the mixture needs to resemble small peas.
* Add the strawberries to the bowl and coat them well with the flour mixture. In a small bowl mix the egg and milk together then add to the flour bowl. Using a spatula mix everything well. Add more flour as needed if dough is too wet and sticks to hands too much. Turn dough over onto a floured surface and shape into a round 8 inch ball.
* Cut the dough into 8 triangles, just like you would cut pizza and place the triangles over a cookie tray lined with parchment paper or a silpat. Brush with the egg wash. You may at this point, sprinkle the scones with additional sugar if you wish.
* Bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.
